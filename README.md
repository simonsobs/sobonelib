# sobonelib
This repository contains code which runs on Beaglebone Black microcontrollers. This code is ment to interact with OCS agents but does not fit within the standard agent structure. Instead these pieces of code run as independent processes on the Beaglebone microcontrollers and interact with agents through UDP data packets.
